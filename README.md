 ## Python Flask Expert Assistant

### Problem Analysis
The problem at hand is to build a Flask application that provides information about football games airing on TV today in the user's country.

### Flask Application Design
To solve this problem, we'll create a Flask application with the following structure:

#### HTML Files
- `index.html`: This will be the main page of the application. It will display a list of football games airing on TV today in the user's country.
- `game_details.html`: This page will display detailed information about a specific game, such as the teams playing, the time and channel of the game, and a link to watch the game online.

#### Routes
- `/`: This route will render the `index.html` page.
- `/game/<game_id>`: This route will render the `game_details.html` page for the specified game.

### Implementation Details
#### HTML Files
- `index.html`:
  - This page will use a table to display the list of games. Each row in the table will represent a game, and the columns will display information such as the teams playing, the time and channel of the game, and a link to watch the game online.
- `game_details.html`:
  - This page will display detailed information about a specific game, such as the teams playing, the time and channel of the game, a link to watch the game online, and a map showing the location of the stadium where the game is being played.

#### Routes
- `/`:
  - This route will query a database or API to retrieve the list of games airing on TV today in the user's country.
  - It will then render the `index.html` page, passing the list of games as a variable.
- `/game/<game_id>`:
  - This route will query a database or API to retrieve detailed information about the specified game.
  - It will then render the `game_details.html` page, passing the game information as a variable.

### Conclusion
This Flask application design provides a simple and effective way to display information about football games airing on TV today in the user's country. It uses a straightforward HTML structure and a few simple routes to achieve the desired functionality.
